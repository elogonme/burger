  **Eat-Da Burger!** is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. This app is a burger logger implemented  with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Codebase is following the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern that structures it into three distinct sections according to a software design philosophy known as the _separation of concerns_. Using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate page HTML.
